Divided by Race, United by Racism

Whoever except Saif, Tawseef, Rownak & Tameem changes the description, group pfp, or group name will lose their rights in this group and will become the same as Junayed Alam.

88

Rules:
☠ Remember, our main aim is to make Raiyan literate & an expert in English (which isn’t possible). Talking about football is allowed, but talking or sending anything related to FC Mobile or similar stuff is not allowed, and no shorts or arguments relating to football(unless the short is from NXCRE and the Villains).Don’t start any backbiting. Make another group for that. Because of dopamine & neurological hacking/manipulation, brainrot isn’t allowed, nor is sending disturbing pics or videos for no reason.
If anyone ever complains about this group, we will have the right to forever bully and kill them (except Junayed Alam, since he is Junayed Alam, he has no rights, so we have the right to bully and kill him whenever we want). Anyone who breaks the rules or complains will be labeled a “Rajakar” as long as they are not Tawseef, Tameem, Saif or Rownak.
If anyone wants to edit the description, they must ask for permission from one of the 4 persons mentioned in the description, except Junayed Alam. If any fight/tension (extreme to the point of TC) breaks out here, then the members responsible will be removed from this group temporarily until they resolve the problem and will be transferred to the subgroup.
List of people who lost their rights in the group:
Adil (if he breaks any more freaking rules, he will be sent straight to the shadow realm), Tahmid (last parole), Tayeeb (last parole) Junayed Alam didn’t have any (because he’s Junayed)
